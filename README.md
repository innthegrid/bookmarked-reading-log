# bookmarked-reading-log
Purdue University CS 348 Project - Reading Log

Chosen framework: Python, Flask, SQL Alchemy, React

Project idea: I want to create a reading log that allows you to track books you have read, are currently reading, and want to read. You can also track reading sessions, including time and pages read, for books you are currently reading. It should have relevant statistics of your reading habits, and allow you to establish and track reading goals. The idea will be further developed as the project progresses.
